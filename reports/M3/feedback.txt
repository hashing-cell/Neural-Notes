- re-half note off: it may be possible that a off-by-one error is occurring so make sure to double check that before debugging the model itself
- re- receiving MIDI file from server: I wouldn't really worry too much about the latency or capacity, since the app is not meant to be real-time. In terms of processing, if the server is not completely set up yet, is there a way to mimic recieving the audio file from the server, so this part can be worked on in parallel with the server? This can also either help catch and problems early before having the deploy the server, as well as give you confidence that the app should work as long as the server does as well.
-  re-image upload: I believe there are libraries that work on the abstraction of images instead of bitstreams, so this part should be straight forward as well, so don't worry.
