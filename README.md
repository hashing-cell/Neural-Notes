# Neural-Notes

Machine-learning final project that takes in a scanned or well-taken sheet of music and outputs the corresponding audio file

The project has three components:

- A front-end Android app that can take a photo or select an existing scanned sheet of music. Contents of this component is found in the Mobile_App directory

- A Flask server that hosts the machine learning model. Contents of this are found in the Server directory

- The machine learning model itself which is developed on Google Colab in the ML_model directory

An in-depth description of both the overall architecture, libraries used, and development decisions and ideas can be found in the reports/final directory.
